# Single page portfolio

This project was derived from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) with the objective of replicating a simple design as closely as possible, while also considering the default rendering behavior of web browsers. It entailed providing practical instructions to guide the browser in rendering the layout effectively. Additionally, Sass was utilized and a compact library was developed for potential reusability in other projects.

This project was actually my first go at building a website using the basics: HTML and CSS. The design turned out awesome and highlighted how much you can do with just HTML and CSS. It was a fantastic learning experience that inspired me to take the next steps in my web development journey.
